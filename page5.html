Just a quick recap on my goals:<br>
1.)Build a “starter kit” of 5 classroom-ready resources 
(links, unplugged activities, videos) etc.
<br>
2.)Learn how to use offline coding activities for grade 9-12 classes (Computer sciences classes)
<br>
3.)Develop knowledge of python 
<br>
4.)Develop a game..start to finish..using scratch
<br>
Looking back on my goals, it safe to say that I have a good start for them all as I do have a few ideas
<br> for offline coding activities based on the ones we learned in class.<br> I also developed a bit of a knowledge
of python and will be going back to develop it further.<br> I also have a starter kit started for resources for using
	in classes.. most of these have to do with Scratch though as I seem to have spent the most time working on that program.<br>
	This brings me to my last goal of developing a game from start to finish, I feel most satisfied with this one as I created
	<br> not one but two artificats using scratch and have them both posted below!<br> I will likely be doing more of those kinds
	of things in scratch as they are so much fun to make!
	<br> All in all, I think I have given myself a good basis for my (hopeful) career in teaching coding to kids.

<p>Scratch Story - Ben, Steve & Griff:<br>This one is another Scratch Tutorial I did. It is a build your own
story. It is interactive and you can play the story simply by clicking a mouse. Took about ten minutes to make.</p>
