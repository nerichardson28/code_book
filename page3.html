<h1>What we did this week: Python</h1>

<br>
Today we learned how to code in Python... I thought I had 
never done it before but <br>
 I do have a vague memory of doing python coding at ACC. 
 <br>
Anyways, we did this by following python tutorials on the university of helsinky website called MOOC. 
<br>
At first it went smoothly and I was able to go through it all fairly quickly. Until I got to Section 3 of the the exercise
	and I could not make the code work. I am sure it was something simple that I was missing, but it had me stumped. 
<br> I did not end up finishing the parts, but I did say that I wanted in my goals to develop a knowledge of python
	and I feel I did that. So I might go back and try again, once I am not as frustrated with it.

<br>
Today we started the class by doing some offline coding activities.
<br> 
 We learned one that mimics what a fax machine when it sends and prints documents (that really dated some of us)
 <br>
WE did a few examples like tea cup, a baby, some letters and 
<br>
then we were to create our own binary code and have a classmate solve it once it was complete. 
<br>
It turned out rather well, but I do think I need more practice creating the binary code and could see myself 
	using an activity like that in my own classroom. 
<br>
On my own, I decided to play around with Scratch (as making a game was one of my goals.)<br> I watched a few
	tutorials on youtube and found some activities to do. <br> one I settled on was creating an interactive story
	that you can control with the click of a mouse.<br> This one was a fun activity and would be cool to build with kids. 
	<br>Scratch is a good program to use and is very user friendly, especially for those who are just learning to code.
