<h1>What we did this week</h1>	
<p class="title">
Started off the class by "programming" DiMuro to make a Jam sandwhich. This was an entertaining, if not a frustrating, activity
	as we had to start at the very beginning going step by step and remember every detail to program the action of making a jam 
	sandwich. This was important because a program or a robot would not know the step by step process of making a sandwich like a
	human might. If I do end up teaching coding, this will be an activity I include because it will show the kids the importance of 
	including all of the steps in the code to get something to work properly. 

<br>
Learned offline coding activity.. cup stacking and writing down the code (using arrows) to stack 
the cups. This is another good hands on example of using all the steps in a code to get the program being worked on to work properly. 
	I think this would be another good activity for those students who might need to see a hands on example to understand how code should work
	before they learn to write it.

<p>This will definitely be an activity I will be incorporating into my classroom when I start teaching. It is a good way for kids to learn what coding is all about in a hands on way.</p></div>

<p>Cup Stack 1:<br>this is the written form of the code used to move the cups into
stacks. It was a bit tricky getting the hang of it but it looks interesting once
it's all written</p>
